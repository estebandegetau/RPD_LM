This section reviews key strands of the unemployment protection literature relevant to the Retiro Parcial por Desempleo (RPD). I begin by outlining the evolution of economic thought on unemployment insurance (UI), followed by empirical evidence on its labor market effects. I then examine how UI functions in developing economies, where informality and weak enforcement complicate its impact. Finally, I turn to pension-linked and quasi-UI schemes, focusing on RPD as a self-financed alternative in a context with limited access to formal unemployment support.

### History of Economic Thought on Unemployment Insurance

Unemployment insurance (UI) has its roots in early 20th-century social insurance schemes, introduced to buffer workers against income loss during joblessness. Economists and policymakers initially debated its merits: while UI promised to stabilize incomes and aggregate demand (especially during downturns like the Great Depression), critics warned even early on that providing benefits to the unemployed could weaken work incentives [@price1985].

Over time, UI became a standard component of the welfare state – by 1935 the U.S. had a federal-state UI system, following earlier European models – and was seen as both a social safety net and an automatic stabilizer for the economy. Classic economic thought began formalizing this trade-off in the 1960s and 1970s. For example, job search theory highlighted that more generous UI would raise workers’ reservation wages and reduce search intensity, potentially lengthening unemployment spells [@stigler1961; @stigler1962].

By the late 1970s, seminal theoretical contributions articulated the balance between consumption smoothing benefits and moral hazard costs of UI. @baily1978 derived the optimal benefit replacement rate under this trade-off, showing that while risk-averse workers gain welfare from smoothing consumption during unemployment, too generous a benefit can induce longer spells of joblessness. Subsequent models, such as @shavell1979 explored optimal time profiles of benefits, suggesting payments should ideally decline over the spell to encourage re-employment. These early theories formalized the notion that UI’s insurance value must be weighed against incentive effects.

Empirically, evidence soon confirmed UI’s consumption-smoothing role: @gruber1997 found that a 10 percentage-point increase in the UI replacement rate reduces the drop in household consumption on job loss by about 2.7%, significantly cushioning unemployed families. This finding provided quantitative support for the idea that UI mitigates welfare losses during unemployment. At the same time, researchers noted that UI could raise unemployment rates. @katz1990 used administrative data to show that a one week increase of UI benefit duration increases the average unemployment duration by 0.16 to 0.20 weeks. Thus, by the 1990s, the economics literature broadly accepted that UI entails a trade-off: it protects income and consumption for the unemployed, but creates moral hazard that can aggravate unemployment.

Importantly, later theoretical work added nuance to this view. General equilibrium and job-matching models indicated that UI might improve the quality of job matches. For instance, @acemoglu2000 argued that more generous UI could lead workers to seek higher-productivity jobs, potentially raising long-run output. Others pointed out that UI’s effect on job-finding could be offset by better matches or higher post-unemployment wages. Over the decades, UI became a focal example of optimal policy design under uncertainty: @hopenhayn1997 derived formulas for an ideal UI system that gradually decreases benefits to incent re-employment, and later “sufficient statistics” approaches (e.g. @chetty2008) quantified the welfare trade-off using risk aversion and behavioral elasticities.

By the 2000s, surveys of the literature (@atkinson1991; @krueger2002) concluded that while UI undoubtedly prolongs unemployment spells, it also substantially raises recipients’ welfare by smoothing consumption and can even yield positive externalities (like better job matches or macroeconomic stabilization). A recent meta-analysis of 55 studies reinforces this historical perspective: it finds that despite some publication bias inflating earlier estimates, UI benefits do have a tangible “disemployment” effect (elasticity of unemployment duration with respect to benefit generosity on the order of 0.2–0.5) – yet an optimal policy is not zero UI, rather a moderate replacement rate around 30% is welfare-maximizing once both insurance and behavioral responses are accounted for [@cohen2024]. In summary, the evolution of economic thought on UI has progressed from simple cautionary tales about work disincentives to a sophisticated understanding of how UI can be designed to balance equity and efficiency over the business cycle.

### Empirical Evidence

A large empirical literature, especially from the 1980s onward, has quantified the labor market effects of unemployment insurance. Early empirical studies used aggregate time-series or cross-sectional variation and found suggestive correlations between generous UI and higher unemployment. However, more rigorous evidence emerged as researchers exploited policy changes and micro-data. The landmark study by @katz1990 demonstrated a sharp spike in the job-finding rate as unemployed workers’ benefits were about to expire, indicating that many workers remained unemployed until their UI ran out and then quickly found jobs. This provided clear evidence that UI availability lengthens unemployment spells. Around the same time, @meyer1990 estimated that higher benefit levels or longer entitlement durations significantly reduce the hazard rate of leaving unemployment, with implied elasticities often in the range of 0.4–0.6. In practical terms, a 10% increase in the UI benefit level was found to increase average unemployment durations by roughly 4–8% in the U.S. context (@krueger2002). Such findings, replicated in Canada and Europe, solidified the consensus that more generous UI leads to longer spells of insured unemployment, all else equal.

Notably, this effect was not merely observational – it was confirmed by natural experiments. For example, when the U.S. extended benefit durations during recessions, researchers observed proportional increases in unemployment length [@moffitt1985]. Similarly, @lalive2008 examined an Austrian program that dramatically extended benefits for older workers (from 1 year to up to 4 years) and found the job-finding rate plummeted for the treated group. In essence, as benefits became available for longer, workers – especially those near retirement age – delayed re-entry into employment. These seminal contributions established a causal link between UI and labor supply behavior, leveraging difference-in-differences (policy reforms across regions or time) and regression discontinuity designs for credible identification.

Over time, researchers applied increasingly creative strategies to pin down causality. Regression discontinuity (RD) designs have been particularly influential. In some countries, UI benefit schedules or durations change discontinuously with age or tenure. @schmieder2012 exploited age thresholds in Germany’s UI system and confirmed that extending UI entitlement by one month causally increases unemployment duration (by roughly 0.1–0.2 months on average), remarkably similar to estimates from the U.S. and elsewhere. Likewise, @lalive2007 and @card2007 used RD and related methods in Austria and found sizable effects on spell length when benefits were extended. The consistency of findings across settings (U.S., Canada, Europe) lent credibility to the external validity of the result: UI dampens the urgency of job search.

In addition, randomized experiments have been conducted to study UI incentives. One famous trial was the Illinois Reemployment Bonus Experiment in the 1980s, which offered UI recipients a lump-sum bonus for quick reemployment. The experiment showed that modest financial incentives (\$500 bonuses) induced earlier exits from unemployment, albeit the effects were not large (e.g. reducing average duration by about a week) and the program’s cost-effectiveness was debated. Nonetheless, it confirmed that unemployed workers respond to financial incentives, reinforcing the evidence that the structure of UI benefits influences behavior.

Beyond unemployment duration, seminal studies have examined how UI affects other labor market outcomes like re-employment wages, job match quality, and long-run earnings. Theoretically, longer search enabled by UI could lead to better matches (higher wages or productivity), but longer non-employment could also erode skills or signal lower productivity to employers. The empirical evidence is mixed. On the one hand, several studies find positive effects on job quality: for example, a recent study in Austria found that a moderate extension of benefits led to a 0.5% increase in re-employment wages on average [@nekoei2017], suggesting that extra search time helped workers find better matches. And in the United States, longer potential UI durations have been linked to unemployed individuals holding out for higher productivity jobs, which can even spur job creation by improving matching efficiency [@centeno2006]. These findings echo the insight of @acemoglu2000 that UI can raise overall productivity.

On the other hand, some research finds little gain in match quality: a study in Germany found a slight reduction in re-employment wages (\~0.8%) when benefits were extended [@schmieder2016] and a study in France detected no discernible impact on subsequent job match quality or wages [@lebarbanchon2016]. Thus, while UI unambiguously lengthens unemployment spells, its impact on post-unemployment outcomes can vary – with some contexts showing improved job matches and others showing flat or slightly negative effects. Part of this difference may arise from whether UI mainly delays acceptance of *sub-par* jobs (thereby improving matches) or whether it causes skill atrophy. Recent meta-analyses and cross-country comparisons indicate that in aggregate, the micro-elasticity of unemployment with respect to UI is similar to the macro-level impact, implying that general equilibrium effects (like wage adjustments or vacancy creation) do not dramatically alter the basic conclusion [@cohen2024]. In summary, the seminal empirical literature – through a combination of natural experiments, policy discontinuities, and even randomized trials – has firmly established that UI benefits *cause* longer unemployment spells, while also highlighting important nuances in terms of search intensity, job quality, and the optimal calibration of UI in different contexts.

### Developing Countries and Informal Labor Markets

While most classic UI studies focus on advanced economies, a growing body of research examines how unemployment benefits operate in developing countries, where labor markets are characterized by high informality and weaker administrative capacity [@ulku]. In many developing economies, formal UI systems either did not exist historically or covered only a small fraction of workers. Instead, governments often relied on protective labor regulations – such as stringent job security rules and mandated severance pay – as a way to shield workers from income loss. This "protecting jobs" approach (e.g. requiring large severance payouts or restricting layoffs) was seen as more feasible in environments without the bureaucratic means to implement a contributory UI system. However, it came at the cost of labor market rigidity [@garibaldi2005]. By the 2000s, there was increasing recognition that overly strict labor regulations impeded job creation, leading to reforms embracing “flexicurity” – flexibility in hiring/firing combined with security via unemployment benefits. Chile’s introduction of a national UI system in 2002 was a pioneering example, and other middle-income countries (Brazil, Colombia, etc.) gradually expanded or created UI programs. Yet, implementing UI in developing contexts raises unique challenges: most notably, the presence of a large informal sector where workers and firms operate outside the regulated, tax-paying economy.

A key question is how informal labor markets interact with unemployment insurance. Conventional wisdom suggested that UI could be especially distortionary in such settings – for example, workers might continue working informally while claiming UI, effectively turning the benefit into a hidden subsidy for off-the-books employment. Indeed, early analyses posited that a large informal sector would magnify UI’s moral hazard problem, as beneficiaries could earn untaxed income without forfeiting benefits [@hartley2011]. Recent research has sought to quantify these effects. In an important study on Brazil, @gerard2021 combined an optimal UI framework with Brazilian data to evaluate whether informality increases the efficiency costs of UI. Using a quasi-experimental variation in benefit duration (an age-based eligibility cutoff for extended benefits), they found the usual result that UI prolongs formal unemployment spells (moral hazard), but intriguingly the efficiency cost was *lower* in Brazil than in the United States. In areas or demographic groups with higher informality, the incremental effect of UI on formal re-employment was smaller, essentially because formal job-finding rates were low to begin with in those high-informality segments. Many workers would remain jobless or informal with or without UI, so the relative “excess” duration caused by benefits was modest. Their conclusion was that moral hazard may actually become a more salient concern as an economy formalizes – a counterintuitive insight that in very informal economies, UI might do less harm than expected (since the alternative to formal unemployment is often informal work or inactivity anyway).

Other evidence from developing countries, however, shows that UI can induce shifts to informal employment during the insured spell. In Brazil, formal employees are legally barred from concurrently holding a registered job while on UI, but they can and often do find unregistered work. @britto2022 provides causal evidence on this behavior. In his study of Brazil’s UI system and severance pay scheme (*Fundo de Garantia do Tempo de Serviço*, FGTS), Britto first uses a regression discontinuity design to show that receiving a lump-sum severance payment (on formal job) lengthens the time until a worker returns to a formal job by about 1.9 weeks after three years since displacement. He then examines a one-month extension of UI benefits (using another discontinuity in eligibility) and finds that the extended UI causes an even larger initial increase in formal unemployment duration compared to the lump-sum. Crucially, by matching administrative data with household surveys, Britto finds that 57% of the “lost” formal employment time under extended UI is offset by increased informal employment. In other words, more than half of those extra weeks of formal joblessness are weeks in which the individuals are working informally while collecting UI. This reveals a strategic response: workers exploit the benefit by substituting formal jobs (which would end UI receipt) with informal work until benefits are exhausted. Such findings underscore the importance of informality as an auxiliary unemployment insurance mechanism in developing economies.

That said, the medium-term impacts of UI in these contexts may be more benign than the short-term behavior suggests. Britto’s analysis shows that although an extra month of UI induces a significant temporary drop in formal employment, those on extended UI partially catch up in employment after benefits expire, so that over a three-year horizon their total time in formal work is similar to those who only got the lump-sum. Moreover, the UI recipients found jobs with higher wages than those who only got the lump-sum severance. This aligns with evidence from other developing settings that UI can improve match quality or give workers more bargaining power. Indeed, Britto finds the one-month UI extension was less harmful to reemployment wages than the lump-sum assistance, possibly because having ongoing benefits allowed workers to hold out for better offers. Similarly, a study in Argentina found that unemployment benefits recipients tended to find formal jobs with slightly higher wages than non-recipients at only a moderate cost of increased unemployment duration [@gonzález-rozada2023].

In summary, global evidence from middle- and low-income countries suggests that the fundamental effects of UI – consumption smoothing and extended job-search time – appear universal, but high informality profoundly shapes outcomes. UI in developing economies often has “leakage” into the informal sector: some share of beneficiaries will work outside the formal system while receiving benefits [@britto2022]. This cushions their income (a form of hidden employment) but undermines the intent of UI and raises questions about monitoring. Yet, the presence of informality can also mean the net social cost of UI is not as high as in a fully formal setting, since many would not have formal jobs regardless [@gerard2021]. Policymakers thus face a dilemma: how to extend unemployment protection to workers in economies where many do not work in the formal sector. Experiments are ongoing – for example, some countries have tested unemployment assistance for self-employed or informal workers (often via cash transfer programs rather than true “insurance”). Overall, the literature underscores that context matters – the optimal design and expected effects of UI in a developing country (with limited enforcement and many informal jobs) will differ from those in a developed economy. Research on Brazil, Mexico, Chile, and others is gradually filling in these gaps, pointing to the importance of complementary policies (like cracking down on informal work by UI claimants, integrating informal workers into the system through incentives or through active labor market policies) to make unemployment protection effective in the developing world.

### Pension-Integrated and Quasi-UI Schemes

Beyond traditional unemployment insurance, many countries have implemented or experimented with alternative mechanisms to protect workers against job loss. These *pension-adjacent* or *quasi-UI* schemes include programs like lump-sum severance pay, unemployment savings accounts, and allowing early withdrawals from pension funds during unemployment. Such schemes are especially common in countries that lack a comprehensive UI system or seek to reduce the moral hazard associated with standard UI benefits.

Severance pay is the oldest and most widespread alternative to UI. Under severance mandates, employers must provide a one-time payout to workers upon involuntary separation, typically based on tenure. This lump-sum acts as a form of unemployment compensation, but it is financed at the firm level and paid only at layoff. Many Latin American and Asian countries historically relied on severance pay in lieu of UI. However, severance has well-documented shortcomings: it usually covers only formal sector layoffs, provides no help to those who quit or were informally employed, and may deter employers from hiring, or encourage firing workers before they accumulate tenure.

Recognizing the limitations of pure severance pay, some countries have adopted Unemployment Insurance Savings Accounts (UISAs) or hybrid systems that combine self-insurance with social insurance. The idea of UISAs, posited by academics like @feldstein2007, @orszag2002 and @stiglitz2005, is to have each worker accumulate savings in an individual account during employment, which can be drawn down during periods of unemployment. If the worker’s account balance is insufficient, a public solidarity fund or government backstop can cover the difference, ensuring a minimum benefit, but importantly, any unused balance remains the worker’s property, often convertible to retirement funds. This mechanism aims to *internalize the cost* of unemployment benefits – since workers essentially pay for their own UI (at least up to a point), they have less incentive to abuse the system. In theory, UISAs should reduce the moral hazard problem inherent in pooled UI, because any withdrawal today will deplete one’s own savings (or future pension), thereby discouraging unnecessary use.

Chile’s UI system, introduced in 2002, is a flagship example of UISA. It established individual unemployment accounts financed by payroll contributions, alongside a common *Fondo Solidario* for those who exhaust their savings or have very low balances [@hartley2011]. Workers first draw benefits from their personal account; only if that is empty (and if they meet eligibility criteria) do they receive benefits from the solidarity pool. This two-tier design was intended to preserve work incentives while still providing a safety net for the most vulnerable. By 2008, about 80% of Chilean private-sector workers were contributing to these accounts, and the system had expanded coverage dramatically compared to the old severance pay regime.

Studies evaluating Chile’s reform find encouraging results. @hartley2011 reported that the introduction of UISAs improved re-employment incentives: workers with ample savings in their accounts did not prolong their unemployment spells as much as they would have under a pure UI system, since they were drawing on their own funds. In line with this, the authors found that an extension of benefits financed by the solidarity fund led to longer unemployment durations (a moral hazard effect), whereas those relying solely on their individual accounts showed no increase in unemployment duration. This absence of behavioral response in the self-funded tier suggests that when workers use their own money (forced-savings) for unemployment, they treat it differently than a no-strings-attached benefit [@ulku]. Essentially, Chile’s experience showed that moral hazard may be sharply reduced by the UISA design – a finding consistent with theoretical expectations.

Following Chile, countries like Colombia and Mauritius implemented similar savings-account-based unemployment benefit schemes [@ulku]. Colombia, for instance, has a program of *cesantías* (unemployment savings) where employers deposit a month’s pay per year into an account that workers can withdraw upon separation or other contingencies. These systems blur the line between pensions and unemployment insurance, effectively using a pre-funded individual buffer to handle job-loss income shocks.

Mexico provides a salient case of a quasi-UI pension withdrawal scheme with the *Retiro Parcial por Desempleo* (RPD). Lacking a formal UI program for most workers[^1], Mexico allows individuals to make a withdrawal from their Afore (individual retirement savings account) when they become unemployed. This policy, in effect since the early 2000s, treats the retirement account as a self-insurance vehicle for unemployment.[^2] Studies by Mexico’s pension regulator have noted a sharp increase in such withdrawals, especially during the COVID-19 Pandemic, and have continued to raise since [@consar2024], likely due to the increased salience that the program achieved during the employment crisis that followed the COVID-19 pandemic.

[^1]: A state-level unemployment insurance was implemented in Mexico City, albeit coverage is low, eligibility rules are obscure, and its benefits are small since it is funded through the state budget [@loaaguirre2019].

[^2]: I present the features of the RPD program in detail in @sec-context.

Empirical evidence of the RPD scheme is still emerging. One concern is that allowing easy access to pension funds in mid-career could undermine long-term savings adequacy. Another is that, similar to severance, a one-off withdrawal may be spent quickly. Evidence from Brazil’s severance suggests people exhibit *present bias*: @gerard2021a showed that upon layoff, Brazilian workers who received their FGTS lump-sum increased their consumption by 35% in the initial weeks, even though they subsequently faced a 14% drop in consumption in the longer term. This indicates that lump-sum payments tend to be consumed rather than smoothed, potentially leaving individuals unprotected later in their unemployment spell. We might expect a similar pattern for pension withdrawals – an upfront infusion that could be exhausted before re-employment, thereby failing to fully smooth income over the unemployment duration.

@velázquezguadarrama2023 used public data from the *Encuesta Nacional de Ocupación y Empleo* (ENOE) and a regression discontinuity design to show that the RPD program has several significant causal effects on labor market outcomes. Specifically, the study estimates that being eligible for the RPD increases salary income by 2.47%, suggesting that having access to these funds allows individuals to pursue potentially riskier, better-paying jobs or engage in longer hiring processes. He also finds that eligibility increases the probability of being employed by 2.67%, a result noted as potentially counterintuitive, but which might be explained by individuals taking jobs perceived as having a higher risk of future unemployment or, importantly, demonstrating that the moral hazard often associated with traditional unemployment insurance is mitigated since the funds are drawn from the individual's own savings. Finally, eligibility leads to an estimated increase in the duration of unemployment by 83 days, implying that individuals eligible for the program utilize the financial support to extend their job search and find a better match for their skills and needs. These results collectively suggest that integrating unemployment benefits with a pension system, can be an effective mechanism for mitigating moral hazard while potentially improving resource allocation in the labor market through higher wages and employment probability, despite increasing the duration of unemployment.

Moreover, @carreñogodínez2025 also used ENOE data and a Difference-in-Differences design to show that eligibility for the RPD is estimated to increase the probability of transitioning into entrepreneurship. Depending on the model specification used, this increase is estimated to be between 5.01% and 21.4% greater for eligible individuals compared to those who do not meet the eligibility criteria. Carreño interprets these results as evidence that, in a context like Mexico where access to credit is limited and a traditional state-funded unemployment insurance does not exist, the early withdrawal mechanism from individual retirement accounts (Afore) functions as a financial safety net. This access to financial resources appears to facilitate the creation of new businesses by providing individuals with the necessary support to undertake the risky decision of starting an enterprise. These findings suggest that mechanisms allowing access to individual savings can indirectly promote entrepreneurship by providing a lump-sum payment to the unemployed.
