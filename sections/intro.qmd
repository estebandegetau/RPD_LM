Job loss can cause severe income disruptions, yet in the absence of public intervention, workers must self-insure by borrowing, drawing down savings, or relying on informal support networks. Economists have long argued that such self-insurance is inefficient: when credit markets are incomplete and workers are risk-averse, precautionary strategies often fall short, and the welfare losses from income volatility can be large. Unemployment insurance (UI) programs address this market failure by pooling risk across individuals and time, thereby enabling workers to smooth consumption during periods of joblessness [@baily1978; @gruber1997]. Beyond their insurance function, UI programs may also improve job match quality by reducing the urgency to accept the first available job, leading to higher earnings and long-run productivity [@acemoglu1999; @acemoglu2000].

These benefits, however, must be balanced against potential moral hazard; generous benefits may reduce the urgency to search for work, prolonging unemployment. In developing countries, where fiscal capacity is limited and informality widespread, traditional UI systems are often unviable. As a result, many governments rely on self-financed alternatives designed to provide limited liquidity while minimizing work disincentives. One such program is Mexico’s *Retiro Parcial por Desempleo* (RPD), which allows unemployed formal-sector workers to withdraw a portion of their pension savings upon job loss.

This paper addresses the question: What are the causal labor market effects of access to the RPD program in Mexico? I study the impact of RPD eligibility and take-up on three key outcomes: (i) job search behavior, proxied by unemployment duration and employment survival; (ii) job quality, measured by reemployment wages and job duration; and (iii) medium-term labor market performance, defined as formal earnings and months worked in the three years following displacement. Understanding these effects is critical for assessing whether quasi-UI schemes like RPD enable better job matches or merely delay reemployment, and whether they reinforce or mitigate longer-term income risks.

A growing body of research has examined the effects of UI on labor market outcomes in both high- and low-income contexts. In advanced economies, natural experiments and regression discontinuity designs show that more generous UI consistently prolongs unemployment spells [e.g., @katz1990; @schmieder2012]. Evidence on job quality is more mixed: while some studies report gains in reemployment wages and job stability [e.g., @nekoei2017; @centeno2006], others find negligible or even adverse effects on earnings [e.g., @schmieder2016; @lebarbanchon2016]. In middle-income countries, UI interacts with informality in complex ways. For instance, @britto2022 finds that in Brazil, over half of the additional unemployment induced by extended UI is offset by increased informal employment, raising concerns about behavioral leakage and program effectiveness.

This study contributes to the literature by being the first to estimate the causal impact of Mexico’s RPD program using administrative data and a fuzzy regression discontinuity design. While earlier causal studies [e.g., @velázquezguadarrama2023; @carreñogodínez2025] relied on survey data, I leverage high-frequency longitudinal records from the Mexican social security system to construct a clean analytic sample and directly observe eligibility, take-up, and formal labor market trajectories. The RPD's eligibility threshold—requiring at least two years of social security contributions—offers a compelling quasi-experimental setting. By exploiting this discontinuity and tracking administrative take-up, I estimate local average treatment effects (LATEs) for compliers across a rich set of labor market outcomes. While internal validity is strong, generalizability is limited to younger formal-sector workers near the eligibility threshold.

The results show that RPD take-up has large and significant effects on unemployment duration: users remain unemployed for approximately 36 additional weeks over a three-year period, from a baseline of 51 weeks for the ineligible, with effects evident within the first three months after displacement. However, these extended unemployment spells do not translate into higher job quality. On average, RPD users do not experience gains in wages, job duration, or cumulative earnings. In fact, most subgroups—particularly lower-income, younger, and female workers—experience substantial earnings losses over the three-year horizon. Although some subgroups, such as higher-income or male workers, see small gains in reemployment earnings, these are not sufficient to offset longer unemployment spells. These findings challenge optimistic models of UI that predict gains in productivity and matching quality [@acemoglu2000], and instead suggest that self-financed programs like RPD may distort job search without delivering meaningful returns in terms of labor market outcomes.

Importantly, heterogeneity analyses reveal that the effects of RPD vary markedly across demographic and macroeconomic conditions. Younger and lower-wage workers face much larger increases in unemployment and sharper earnings losses—suggesting that RPD may exacerbate, rather than alleviate, pre-existing vulnerabilities, and thus renforce inequality. In contrast, workers displaced during the COVID-19 crisis exhibit smaller increases in unemployment and even experience modest gains in cumulative earnings. This points to a potentially countercyclical role for liquidity provision, where temporary support during downturns may cushion income losses and facilitate labor market reintegration.

These findings offer several policy-relevant insights. First, the structure of the RPD program; being self-financed and actuarially neutral—appears to reduce concerns about fraud and fiscal burden but also limits its redistributive potential. Second, the regressive nature of its benefits—favoring those with more savings and stronger labor market histories—raises concerns about equity and adequacy. Lastly, while the program may be appropriate as a minimal safety net, it does not substitute for the functions of traditional unemployment insurance. The results contribute empirical grounding to policy debates in Mexico and other developing economies over whether to expand self-financed schemes, replace them with publicly funded UI, or design hybrid systems tailored to institutional capacity.

Nonetheless, the study has limitations. The fuzzy RD design identifies local treatment effects for a narrow group of workers—those displaced in their third year of formal labor market participation—limiting external validity. Moreover, the administrative data do not capture transitions into informal employment or broader welfare outcomes, such as psychological stress or household income dynamics. Finally, the modest first stage—only a 4 percentage point increase in take-up—constrains precision in second-stage estimates and necessitates cautious interpretation.
