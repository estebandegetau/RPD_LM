This thesis evaluates the labor market effects of Mexico’s *Retiro Parcial por Desempleo* (RPD), a policy that allows displaced formal sector workers to make early withdrawals from their pension savings. Leveraging a discontinuity at two years of social security contributions, I implement a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to estimate the local average treatment effect of program take-up on labor market outcomes.

The results show that RPD take-up substantially increases unemployment duration, with significant effects observable as early as three months after displacement and persisting over a three-year horizon. The increase in non-employment is large and robust, suggesting that liquidity provision through the RPD distorts job search incentives. However, there is no consistent evidence that RPD take-up improves job quality or medium-term formal labor income. While some groups—particularly higher-income or male workers—experience modest earnings gains upon reemployment, these are offset by longer unemployment spells. For lower-income, younger, and female workers, RPD take-up is associated with longer unemployment and cumulative earnings losses, although some of these estimates are imprecise.

Take-up rates remain low, and the first-stage estimates are small but precise, indicating that the program successfully targets a narrow set of workers. Notably, heterogeneity analysis reveals that labor market context plays a crucial role: among workers displaced during the COVID-19 pandemic, RPD take-up did not extend unemployment duration and is even associated with higher total earnings. These findings suggest that the RPD may serve a countercyclical role, particularly in times of systemic labor market disruption.

Several limitations of the study should be acknowledged. First, the fuzzy RD design identifies local effects for compliers—those induced to take up the program by marginal eligibility—limiting external validity. Second, the administrative data do not capture informal employment or non-wage welfare outcomes, potentially understating total adjustment margins. Third, despite large point estimates, wide confidence intervals in the second stage warrant cautious interpretation.

My results underscore the institutional tensions in Mexico’s fragmented income protection system. Severance pay, the de jure main income substitute, is often inaccessible due to weak legal enforcement [@sadka2024; @degetau2023]. In this context, the RPD emerges as a second-best option: it is self-financed, administratively simple, and unlikely to induce fraud. Yet this model shifts the burden of income protection onto workers themselves—especially those with fewer savings—thereby reinforcing labor market inequalities.

A more ambitious policy agenda would involve developing a publicly funded unemployment insurance system that ensures risk-sharing beyond individual savings. However, such a system would require overcoming institutional barriers: effective delivery depends not only on eligibility design but also on credible enforcement and administrative capacity. 

The findings point to several promising directions for future research. First, aggregate behavioral effects—such as changes in employer hiring or firing practices—remain an open question. Second, the observed heterogeneity by income, age, gender, and macroeconomic context calls for richer models of household and labor market behavior under liquidity constraints. Finally, the intersection between legal institutions and social protection policy in low-capacity states remains an underexplored but vital area for understanding the design and implementation of unemployment assistance in developing countries.
