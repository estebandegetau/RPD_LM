# Introduction

## Motivation

In Mexico, formal workers can make a partial unemployment withdrawal from their pension accounts (AFORE) — known as *Retiro Parcial por Desempleo*.

This quasi-unemployment insurance is a key income support mechanism in the absence of a formal UI system — yet its labor market effects remain unknown.

Policy relevance:

-   Over 2 million workers per year use this scheme, but we lack causal evidence on how it shapes labor market behavior.

-   It may help smooth income, but could also distort job search incentives or weaken long-term attachment to formal employment.

## Open questions

Despite its scale, little is known about the labor market impacts of this policy:

-   Does access to funds improve job search outcomes?

-   Does it increase informal work or delay re-entry into formal jobs?

-   What are the trade-offs between immediate liquidity and future pension adequacy?

Understanding these effects is crucial for policy design:

-   Should such programs be expanded or restricted?

-   How do they compare with traditional UI or severance pay?

## Research question

What are the labor market outcomes of the retiro parcial por desempleo?

I analyze both short-term job search outcomes:

-   Unemployment duration

-   Quality of the next job

And medium-term labor market effects over 3 years:

-   Total earnings

-   Average monthly earnings

-   Months worked

By leveraging a sharp eligibility cutoff, this research provides credible **causal evidence** on a large-scale but under-studied policy.

## Lump-sum severance and labor market outcomes

@britto2022 — Brazil, RD design: Compares lump-sum severance (FGTS) vs. contingent monthly UI benefits.

Lump-sum severance effects over 3 years after displacement:

-   +1.9 weeks out of formal job.

-   -3.6% in formal labor earnings.

-   \~57% of the differential unemployment spell is spent in informal work.

UI has smaller negative effect on reemployment wages than lump-sum!

-   Unexpected, as UI is thought to be more distortive because it is more generous and its benefits are spread over time.

## Lump-sum severance and consumption smoothing

@gerard2021a — Brazil, Event study / DiD using linked admin + expenditure data (FGTS)

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Lump-sum recipients increase consumption by 35% initially.

-   Later face 14% drop: poor smoothing.

-   Shows risk of present-biased behavior of lump-sum unemployment benefits.

## Incentive alignment effects

@hartley2011 — Chile, UI Savings Accounts (UISA) Design: Natural experiment / DiD

Does integrating UI to pension individual accounts make individuals **internalize** the cost of unemployment and incentivize job search?

-   Although the causal link is ambiguous, as there is selection into UISA, beneficiaries of the *solidarity fund* are less likely to exit unemployment in the early months.

- This is consistent with the idea that the negative effect of UI on unemployment duration is **weaker** as it is funded directly by the worker.

## Gaps in the literature

UI effects are well-studied in high-income countries, often using RD and DiD: UI causes longer unemployment spells consistently, but a waker link on job quality.

-   However, evidence from **developing countries** is still emerging, especially in *high-informality* contexts.

Brazil and Chile offer key case studies on UI and severance systems

-   But Mexico’s AFORE-based quasi-UI (*Retiro Parcial por Desempleo*) remains empirically unexplored.

Studies show informal work as an escape valve during UI [@gerard2021]

-   But we lack causal evidence on how early pension withdrawals affect formal re-employment and job quality.



# Context: *Retiro Parcial por Desempleo* in Mexico

## Unemployment benefits in Mexico

Mexico is amongst the developing countries that lacks a formal unemployment insurance system.

- Employers are supposed to make a *mandatory severance* payment of 90 days of salary to workers who are laid off without just cause.

As @sadka2024 have shown, the severance system is hindered by weak enforcement:

-  Over 50% of dismissed workers report not receiving severance pay.

- However, only 13% file a claim to the labor courts, as they (correctly) perceive the process ineffective. 

- 30% of lawsuits remain unsolved after 4 years.

- Among plaintiffs who won court judgments, only 20% collected the full amount awarded.

## The *Retiro Parcial por Desempleo*

The *Retiro Parcial por Desempleo* allows workers to withdraw a portion of their individualized pension savings (AFORE) in case of unemployment.



## Eligibility criteria

A worker who meets the eligibility criteria in @fig-eligibility and has been without a formal job for 46 days can withdraw up to:

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}



A.  Ten months of the minimum wage or one month of her most recent wage, whichever is lower.

B.  Three times her monthly wage of 11.5% of her accumulated pension savings, whichever is lower.

Having used the *Retiro Parcial por Desempleo* once, a worker can only withdraw again after 5 years.

# Emprical strategy

## Intent-to-treat

I leverage the sharp eligibility cutoff of two years of SS contributions to estimate the causal effect of the *Retiro Parcial por Desempleo* on labor market outcomes using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) of the form:

$$
Y_{i} = \alpha + \beta D_i + f(C_i - 2) + \epsilon_i \quad \text{where} \quad |C_i - 2| \le h
$$ {#eq-rdd}


 - $Y_{i}$ is an outcome of interest,

 - $C_i$ is worker $i$'s contributions to SS measured in years,  

 - $D_i$ indicates i's eligibility status: whether $C_i \ge 2$, and 

 - $f(\cdot)$ is a polynomial function of $C_i$ and $h$ is the bandwidth around the threshold.

## ITT Assumptions

$\beta$ in @eq-rdd represents the estimate of the causal effect of **being eligible** for the *Retiro Parcial por Desempleo* on labor market outcomes if:

i. **No bunching:** workers cannot manipulate their eligibility status, and

i. **Continiuty:** wokrkers' features are smooth around the eligibility threshold.


## Treatment-on-the-treated

Using data on take-up, I estimate the treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) effect of the *Retiro Parcial por Desempleo* on labor market outcomes using a **fuzzy** regression discontinuity that can be expressed as a two-stage least squares model:

First stage:

$$
T_{i} = \alpha + \beta D_i + f(C_i - 2) + \epsilon_i \quad \text{where} \quad |C_i - 2| \le h
$$ {#eq-1s}

Second stage:

$$
Y_i = \gamma + \tau \hat T_i + f(C_i - 2) + \epsilon_i \quad \text{where} \quad |C_i - 2| \le h
$$ {#eq-2s}

- $T_{i}$ is the treatment status of worker $i$ (whether they took the *Retiro Parcial por Desempleo*),

- $\hat T_{i}$ is the predicted value of $T_{i}$ from @eq-1s, and

- $\tau$ represents the estimate of the causal effect of **taking** the *Retiro Parcial por Desempleo* on labor market outcomes.

## TOT Assumptions

In addition to the assumptions for the ITT, the TOT estimate $\tau$ is valid if:

iii. **Monotonicity:** the first stage is strong enough.

# Data

## Data sources

I leverage two confidential administrative datasets from the *Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social* (IMSS):

i. **Cuenta individual**: Matched employee-employer panel tracking the entire formal labor market in Mexico.

ii. **Retiro Parcial por Desempleo**: Administrative records of all workers who took the *Retiro Parcial por Desempleo* (see @fig-rpd).

## Summary of results

1. Though not statistically significant, RPD takers will be unemployed for 9 weeks longer by the end of the first year since displacement.

1. Next job quality is by no menas affected by the RPD.

1. Over the medium term, RPD takers will have earned ~$100,000 pesos less in the formal labor market. This is driven by both intensive and extensive margins:
    
    -   They will have worked 5 months less in the formal labor market.

    -   They will have earned $2,400 pesos less per month.

## Summary of results

1. **Income:** The effect on unemployment duration was **way larger** for poorer workers, while the earnings effect was no different across groups.

    - Consistent with the idea that duration is affected by liquidity constraints.

1. **Age:** The effect on unemployment duration was **larger** for younger workers, while the earnings effect was no different across groups.

    - Consistent with the idea that younger workers have less attachment to the formal labor market.

## Summary of results

3. **Covid**: The effect on unemployment duration was almost entirely driven by unemployment displacement that happened before March 2019, and had no exposure to the pandemic.

    - Displaced workers fully exposed to the pandemic (March 2020 or later) did not se a negative effect on unemployment duration!

    - Moreover, exposed workers saw a **positive** effect on earnings!

    - This seems to indicate that the positive effects of UI are indeed larger during employment crises, albeit at the cost of longer unemployment spells during normal times.

## Closing remarks

1. Consistent with the UI literature, the *Retiro Parcial por Desempleo* causes longer unemployment spells, although the effects are **not quite** statistically significant.

1. Contrary to the more optimistic UI literature [@acemoglu1999; @acemoglu2000], the *Retiro Parcial por Desempleo* does not seem to improve job quality or medium-term labor earnings.

1. The low take up and large standard errors may indicate that the *Retiro Parcial por Desempleo* achieves its designed objective of **aligning incentives** for job search, plausibly at the cost of lower consumption smoothing.

1. The design seems to be rather helpful during **employment crises**, as the effect on unemployment duration is null, and the effect on earnings is positive.
