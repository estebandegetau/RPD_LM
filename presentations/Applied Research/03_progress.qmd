## Validity of empirical strategy

Recall I showed my empirical strategy was *valid*:

1.  We saw there was no bunching around the eligibility threshold: i.e. workers do not manipulate their way into eligibility. 

2. I showed that covariates (age, gender, previous job, etc.) are continuous around the eligibility threshold.

## Usage of RPD

## An alternative to eligibility after 12 months

## Challenges

- First stage results show my computations are correct. Indeed, the research design is valid.

- However, the take up rate is low: around 7% for those at the right of the cutoff by one year after displacement.

- Using propensity score weights does not increase power, as my covariates do not predict take up.

- Next steps: show that younger and lower income workers see significant labor market outcomes.
